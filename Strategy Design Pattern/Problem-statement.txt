Title: Customer-Service Management System
-----------------------------------------------
Problem Statement:
In the context of managing services for different types of customers, the 
Customer Service Management System aims to provide possble service provision for 
VIP, Normal, and Basic customers.

Description:
The Customer Service Management System addresses the needs of service-oriented
organization. 
The system includes the following key components:
1. Customer Types:
   - VIP Customer: Represents high-value customers with premium service requirements.
   - Normal Customer: Represents standard customers with typical service requirements.
   - Basic Customer: Represents budget-conscious customers with basic service needs.
2. Customer Interface:
   - The system defines the `ICustomer` interface, outlining the common 
     attributes and methods expected for all customer types.
   - Each customer type (VIP, Normal, Basic) extends the abstract `Customer` 
     class and implements the `ICustomer` interface.
3. Service Management:
   - The system defines the `IService` interface, specifying the structure and 
     functionality of individual services.
   - Service classes such as `ServiceA`, `ServiceB`, and `ServiceC`
     implement the `IService` interface, providing concrete implementations 
     of various services offered by the organization.
4. Service Provisioning:
   - Upon instantiation, each customer type receives default service
     packages corresponding to its category.
   - The system allows customers to update their service packages by
     passing arrays of desired services to the appropriate method.
5. Implementation:
   - The system leverages TypeScript to define interfaces, abstract 
     classes, and concrete implementations of customer types and services.
   - Through modular design and encapsulation, the system promotes code
     reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
